 Project for the Build a Technical Documentation Page FreeCodeCamp's challenge. It's not meant to be a tutorial for Python at all, but for the project goals I prefered to use some "real" text I grabbed from random tutorials online than to use <em>lorem ipsum</em>. 
 
 The goal of the challenge was to produce a webpage with semantic html. The body is divided into a navbar (responsive to screen size) and a main element divided into several sections, each with a corresponding header linked to a nav-link in the navbar.
