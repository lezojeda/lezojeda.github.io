          Introduction
        </header>
        <p>Python is an easy to learn, powerful programming language. It has:
          <ul>
            <li>Efficient</li>
            <li>High-level data structures</li>
            <li>Simple but effective approach to object-oriented programming</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <p>Python’s elegant syntax and dynamic typing, together with its interpreted nature, make it an ideal language
          for
          scripting and rapid application development in many areas on most platforms.
        </p>

        <p>The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are freely available in source or binary form for
          all
          major platforms from the <a href="https://www.python.org/">Python Web site</a>, and may be freely distributed.
          The same site also contains distributions of and pointers to many free third party Python modules, programs
          and
          tools, and additional documentation.
        </p>

        <p>This tutorial introduces the reader informally to the basic concepts and features of the Python language and
          system. It helps to have a Python interpreter handy for hands-on experience, but all examples are
          self-contained, so the tutorial can be read off-line as well.
        </p>

        <p>For a description of standard objects and modules, see The Python Standard Library. The Python Language
          Reference gives a more formal definition of the language. To write extensions in C or C++, read Extending and
          Embedding the Python Interpreter and Python/C API Reference Manual. There are also several books covering
          Python
          in depth.
        </p>

        <p>This tutorial does not attempt to be comprehensive and cover every single feature, or even every commonly
          used
          feature. Instead, it introduces many of Python’s most noteworthy features, and will give you a good idea of
          the
          language’s flavor and style.

          What is Python?
        </header>
        <p>Python is an <em>interpreted, object-oriented, high-level programming language</em><img src="https://upload.wikimedia.org/wikipedia/commons/thumb/c/c3/Python-logo-notext.svg/200px-Python-logo-notext.svg.png" alt= "Python logo"> with dynamic semantics
          created around the 1980s. Its high-level built in data structures, combined with dynamic typing and dynamic
          binding, make it very attractive for Rapid Application Development, as well as for use as a scripting or glue
          language to connect existing components together. Python's simple, easy to learn syntax emphasizes readability
          and therefore reduces the cost of program maintenance. Python supports modules and packages, which encourages
          program modularity and code reuse. The Python interpreter and the extensive standard library are available in
          source or binary form without charge for all major platforms, and can be freely distributed.
        </p>

        <p>Often, programmers fall in love with Python because of the increased productivity it provides. Since there is
          no compilation step, the edit-test-debug cycle is incredibly fast. Debugging Python programs is easy: a bug or
          bad input will never cause a segmentation fault. Instead, when the interpreter discovers an error, it raises
          an
          exception. When the program doesn't catch the exception, the interpreter prints a stack trace. A source level
          debugger allows inspection of local and global variables, evaluation of arbitrary expressions, setting
          breakpoints, stepping through the code a line at a time, and so on. The debugger is written in Python itself,
          testifying to Python's introspective power. On the other hand, often the quickest way to debug a program is to
          add a few print statements to the source: the fast edit-test-debug cycle makes this simple approach very
          effective. </p>

        <header class="section-header" id="using-interpreter">
          Using the Interpreter
        </header>
        <p>The Python interpreter is usually installed as <em>/usr/local/bin/python3.7</em> on those machines where it
          is
          available; putting <em>/usr/local/bin</em> in your Unix shell’s search path makes it possible to start it by
          typing the command:
          <code class="code"> python3.7</code>
          to the shell. 1 Since the choice of the directory where the interpreter lives is an installation option, other
          places are possible; check with your local Python guru or system administrator. (E.g.,
          <em>/usr/local/python</em> is a popular alternative location.)</p>

        <p>Typing an end-of-file character (Control-D on Unix, Control-Z on Windows) at the primary prompt causes the
          interpreter to exit with a zero exit status. If that doesn’t work, you can exit the interpreter by typing the
          following command: <code class="code">quit()</code> </p>
      </section>
      <section class="main-section" id="An_Informal_Introduction_to_Python">
        <header class="section-header" id="informal-introduction">
          An Informal Introduction to Python
        </header>
        <p>In the following examples, input and output are distinguished by the presence or absence of prompts (>>> and
          …): to repeat the example, you must type everything after the prompt, when the prompt appears; lines that do
          not
          begin with a prompt are output from the interpreter. Note that a secondary prompt on a line by itself in an
          example means you must type a blank line; this is used to end a multi-line command.</p>
        <p>Many of the examples in this manual, even those entered at the interactive prompt, include comments. Comments
          in Python start with the hash character, <em>#</em>, and extend to the end of the physical line. A comment may
          appear at the start of a line or following whitespace or code, but not within a string literal. A hash
          character
          within a string literal is just a hash character. Since comments are to clarify code and are not interpreted
          by
          Python, they may be omitted when typing in examples.</p>

        <code class="code"># this is the first comment<br/>
          spam = 1  # and this is the second comment<br/>
          # ... and now a third!<br/>
          text = "# This is not a comment because it's inside quotes."</code>

        <h2>Using Python as a Calculator</h2>
        <p>The interpreter acts as a simple calculator: you can type an expression at it and it will write the value.
          Expression syntax is straightforward: the operators <span class="character">+</span>, <span
            class="character">-</span>, <span class="character">*</span> and <span class="character">/</span> work just
          like in most other languages (for example, Pascal or C); parentheses (<span class="character">()</span>) can
          be
          used for grouping. For example:
          <code class="code"> >>> 2 + 2 <br>
                  4 <br>
                  >>> 50 - 5*6 <br>
                  20 <br>
                  >>> (50 - 5*6) / 4 <br>
                  5.0 <br>
                  >>> 8 / 5  # division always returns a floating point  number <br>
        1.6 </code>
        </p>
        <p>The equal sign (=) is used to assign a value to a variable. Afterwards, no result is displayed before the
          next
          interactive prompt:
        </p>
        <code class="code">>>> width = 20 <br>
          >>> height = 5 * 9 <br>
          >>> width * height <br>
        900
        </code>

      <section class="main-section" id="Control_Flow_Tools:_if_and_else">
        <header class="section-header" id="if-else">
          Control Flow Tools: if and else
        </header>
        <p>Perhaps the most well-known statement type is the <span class=character>if</span> statement. For example:
          <code class="code">>>> x = int(input("Please enter an integer: ")) <br>
            Please enter an integer: 42 <br>
            >>> if x < 0: <br>
            ...     x = 0 <br>
            ...     print('Negative changed to zero') <br>
            ... elif x == 0: <br>
            ...     print('Zero') <br>
            ... elif x == 1: <br>
            ...     print('Single') <br>
            ... else: <br>
            ...     print('More')<br>
            ...<br>
            More</code>
          There can be zero or more <em>elif</em> parts, and the <em>else</em> part is optional. The keyword
          <em>‘elif’</em> is short for <em>‘else if’</em>, and is useful to avoid excessive indentation. An <em>if …
            elif
            … elif</em> … sequence is a substitute for the <span class="character">switch</span> or <span
            class="character">case</span> statements found in other languages.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="For_and_while">
        <header class="section-header" id="for-while">
          For and while
        </header>
        <p>Python has two primitive loop commands:<br>
          <ul>
            <li><span class="character">while loops<span></li>
            <li><span class="character">for loops<span></li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <p>The <em>for</em> statement in Python differs a bit from what you may be used to in C or Pascal. Rather than
          always iterating over an arithmetic progression of numbers (like in Pascal), or giving the user the ability to
          define both the iteration step and halting condition (as C), Python’s for statement iterates over the items of
          any sequence (a list or a string), in the order that they appear in the sequence. For example (no pun
          intended):
          <code class="code"> # Measure some strings:<br>
          ... words = ['cat', 'window', 'defenestrate']<br>
          >>> for w in words:<br>
          ...     print(w, len(w))<br>
          ...<br>
          cat 3<br>
          window 6<br>
          defenestrate 12</code></p>
        <p>With the <em>while</em> loop we can execute a set of statements as long as a condition is true. For
          example:<br>
          <code class="code">i = 1 <br> while i < 6: <br>&nbsp; print(i)<br>&nbsp; i+=1</code>
          The <em>while</em> loop requires relevant variables to be ready, in this example we need to define an indexing
          variable, <span class="character">i</span>, which we set to 1.
        </p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Data_Structures">
        <header class="section-header" id="data-structures">
          Data Structures
        </header>
        <p>There are four built-in data structures in Python:
          <ul>
            <li>Lists</li>
            <li>Tuples</li>
            <li>Dictionaries</li>
            <li>Sets</li>
          </ul>
        </p>
        <h2>Lists</h2>
        <p>A <span class="character">list</span> is a data structure that holds an ordered collection of items i.e. you
          can store a sequence of items in a list. This is easy to imagine if you can think of a shopping list where you
          have a list of items to buy, except that you probably have each item on a separate line in your shopping list
          whereas in Python you put commas in between them.</p>
        <p>The list of items should be enclosed in square brackets so that Python understands that you are specifying a
          list. Once you have created a list, you can add, remove or search for items in the list. Since we can add and
          remove items, we say that a list is a mutable data type i.e. this type can be altered.</p>

        <h2>Tuples</h2>
        <p>Tuples are used to hold together multiple objects. Think of them as similar to lists, but without the
          extensive
          functionality that the list class gives you. One major feature of tuples is that they are <em>immutable</em>
          like strings i.e. you cannot modify tuples.</p>
        <p>Tuples are usually used in cases where a statement or a user-defined function can safely assume that the
          collection of values (i.e. the tuple of values used) will not change.</p>

        <h2>Dictionaries</h2>
        <p>A dictionary is like an address-book where you can find the address or contact details of a person by knowing
          only his/her name i.e. we associate <em>keys</em> (name) with <em>values</em> (details). Note that the key
          must
          be unique just like you cannot find out the correct information if you have two persons with the exact same
          name.For example:
          <ul>
            <li>'name': 'Jack'</li>
            <li>'address': 'Downtown'</li>
            <li>'hair color': 'black'</li>
          </ul>
        </p>

        <h2>Sets</h2>
        <p>Sets are unordered collections of simple objects. These are used when the existence of an object in a
          collection is more important than the order or how many times it occurs.</p>

        <p>Using sets, you can test for membership, whether it is a subset of another set, find the intersection between
          two sets, and so on.</p>

      <section class="main-section" id="Modules">
        <header class="section-header" id="modules">
          Modules
        </header>
        <p>If you quit from the Python interpreter and enter it again, the definitions you have made (functions and
          variables) are lost. Therefore, if you want to write a somewhat longer program, you are better off using a
          text
          editor to prepare the input for the interpreter and running it with that file as input instead. This is known
          as
          creating a script. As your program gets longer, you may want to split it into several files for easier
          maintenance. You may also want to use a handy function that you’ve written in several programs without copying
          its definition into each program.

          <p>To support this, Python has a way to put definitions in a file and use them in a script or in an
            interactive
            instance of the interpreter. Such a file is called a module; definitions from a module can be imported into
            other modules or into the main module (the collection of variables that you have access to in a script
            executed at the top level and in calculator mode). Some of the most used modules are:</p>
